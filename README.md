# csx730-paging Paging Activity

**Paging** is a common memory management scheme that avoids external fragmentation 
by splitting physical memory into fixed-sized frames and logical memory into blocks
of the same size called pages. In this activity, you will implement some functions
for basic page-based address translation using a page table.

### Getting Started

1. Form into **small groups of two or three** people. These instructions assume that at least one group 
   member is logged into the Nike. 

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `csx730-deadlock`:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cs1730/csx730-paging.git
   ```

1. Change into the `csx730-paging` directory that was just created and look around. 
   There should be a couple different files already present, including a magic `Makefile`
   that will compile, assemble, and link stand-alone C files individually.
   
### Activity Questions

This activity is open book, open notes, and asking your instructor questions is allowed.
You may find Ch. 9 of _Operating System Concepts_ by Silberschatz, Gagne, and Galvin
useful as a reference.

1. Modify `SUBMISSION.md` to include the name, UGA ID number, course number (4730 or 6730) 
   for each group member. Then, **sign the piece of paper that your instructor has at the front 
   of the room.**
   
1. ~Under "Necessary Conditions" in `SUBMISSION.md`, list and define the four~
   ~conditions that must hold simnultaneously in a system for a deadlock to~
   ~arise, according to Silberschatz, Gagne, and Galvin.~
   
1. Experiment with `deadlock.c` by increasing `NTHREAD` and witnessing deadlocks.
   Under the sub-headings of "Resource Allocation Graph" in `SUBMISSION.md`, provide
   example output produced by the program, the edge set for the resource allocation
   graph induced by the output, and the observed cycle. An example for `NTHREAD = 2`
   is provided but should be replace with your own example.

**CHECKPOINT:** Ask your instructor if you have any questions.

1. Create a copy of `deadlock.c` called `safety.c`. 

1. In this checkpoint, you will be implementing part of the banker's algorithm for
   avoiding deadlocks. Several data structures must be maintained to implement
   the banker's algorithm. Under "Data Structures" sub-heading of 
   "Banker's Algorithm" in `SUBMISSION.md`, list and define these data
   structures.
   
1. In `safety.c`, implement the Banker's Safety Algorithm as described by
   Silberschatz, Gagne, and Galvin in Ch. 8.6.3.1.
   
   * Your program should print `SAFE` or `UNSAFE` before and after each resource
     is acquired by a thread.
   * You should test it for `2 ≤ NTHREAD ≤ 5` and resource instance counts as
     high as `2`.
   
1. Under "Safety Algorithm Examples" sub-heading of "Banker's Algorithm" in 
   `SUBMISSION.md`, provide an example output that demonstrate that not all 
   unsafe states lead to deadlock.
   
**CHECKPOINT**

1. Create a copy of `safety.c` called `banker.c`.

1. In `banker.c`, implement the Banker's Resource-Request Algorithm as described by
   Silberschatz, Gagne, and Galvin in Ch. 8.6.3.2.
   
   * You should test it for `2 ≤ NTHREAD ≤ 5`.
   * While not very technical, you can be somewhat confident that your 
     implementation is correct if no deadlock occurs within the first 30 seconds
	 of execution.

**SUBMISSION**

1. **Before 11:55 PM on WED**, double check that your group member names are listed 
   in `SUBMISSION.md` as well as the piece of paper that your instructor has at the 
   front of the room, then submit your activity attempt using the `submit` command. 
   From the parent directory:
   
   ```
   $ submit csx730-deadlock csx730
   ```
   
1. Remember to share this directory with your group members!
